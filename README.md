"# FlightPricePrediction" 
An airline is a company that provides air transport services for traveling passengers and 
freight. Airlines use aircraft to supply these services and may form partnerships or alliances 
with other airlines for codeshare agreements, in which they both offer and operate the same 
flight. Generally, airline companies are recognized with an air operating certificate or 
license issued by a governmental aviation body. Airlines may be scheduled or charter 
operators.
- Airlines assign prices to their services in an attempt to maximize profitability. The pricing of 
airline tickets has become increasingly complicated over the years and is now largely 
determined by computerized yield management systems.
- The price of an Airline Ticket is affected by a number of factors, such as flight duration, days 
left for departure, arrival time and departure time etc. Airline organizations may diminish 
the cost at the time they need to build the market and at the time when the tickets are less 
accessible. They may maximize the costs. The price may rely upon different factors. Each 
factor has its own proprietary rules and algorithms to set the price accordingly. Recent 
advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) makes it possible to infer 
such rules and model the price variation
